PlantriX — My First React Project
PlantriX is my first ever project built using React.js, marking the beginning of my journey into modern frontend development. This project is more than just a task manager — it’s a reflection of my learning process, design choices, and hands-on experience with component-based architecture and state management.

🚀 What is PlantriX?
PlantriX is a clean, responsive, and user-friendly task management application that allows users to:

Add and track daily tasks

Delete tasks when completed or no longer needed

View a list of tasks in a structured format

This application focuses on clarity, simplicity, and usability, all wrapped in a visually pleasing interface.

🛠️ Technologies Used
React.js – for building dynamic UI with components

useState Hook – for managing component state

CSS3 – for beautiful styling and responsive layout

JavaScript (ES6+) – for application logic and interactivity

🎯 Purpose Behind the Project
As my first step into React, I wanted to build something practical, useful, and visually appealing. PlantriX helped me understand:

JSX syntax and component structure

How to handle user input and events

How to manage and update application state

Dynamic rendering of lists with .map()

Basic project structure and file organization in React

💡 What I Learned
How to set up and structure a React project using create-react-app

The importance of separating logic and presentation (JSX + CSS)

Using React hooks like useState for real-time UI updates

Deploying a React app to GitHub Pages

Writing clean, readable, and maintainable code

🎨 UI Highlights
Soft card layout with shadows and spacing

Smooth input and button transitions

Fully responsive design for desktop and mobile

Modern color palette and clean fonts

🙌 Final Thoughts
PlantriX represents not just a todo list, but the beginning of a journey — one that embraces problem-solving, creativity, and continuous learning. I'm excited to continue building more React projects, exploring hooks, APIs, routing, and more advanced concepts as I grow as a frontend developer.
